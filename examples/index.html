  <h1>FireStylus extension for Firebug</h1>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    You need to install 
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/1843/addon-1843-latest.xpi?src=addondetail">FireBug</a> 
    and the 
    <a href="https://raw.github.com/parallel/firestylus/master/releases/firestylus-0.0.2.xpi">FireStylus extension</a> 
    for Firebug to use this sample.
  </p>

  <p>Then, right click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect Element".</p>
  <p>You can also press F12 to launch FireBug and go to the "HTML" pane.</p>

  <p>The Stylus filename and line numbers of the Stylus-generated CSS styles appears rather than those of the generated CSS as suggested by the following screenshot :</p>
